# Volume of the n-Ball

In this program I use a Monte Carlo method to estimate the volume for the unit n-ball as n ranges from 0 to 20.

There exist a few ways to calculate the exact volume of the n-ball but this approach really highlights the strength of Monte Carlo methods, armed with only the fact a n-dimensional ball is contained in an appropriately sized n-dimensional cube we can begin wrangling a very counter intuitive result. No multiple integrals or recursive sequences are required.

## Background

The unit n-ball is the n-dimensional object consisting of all points with distance less than 1 from the origin. For small n examples include: a point (n = 0), an open line segment with endpoints -1 and 1 (n = 1), the interior of the unit circle (n = 2), and the interior of the unit sphere (n = 3). The Lebesgue measure allows us to define an intuitive and appropriate generalization of volume to dimensions different from 3 and is what we will refer to as volume (or sometimes n-volume to make the dimension apparent).

* The 0-volume (counting measure) of a point is 1
* The 1-volume (length) of a line from -1 to 1 is 2
* The 2-volume (area) of the interior of the unit circle is pi
* The 3-volume (volume) of the interior of the unit sphere is 4/3*pi

Seeing this sequence it is natural to think the volume of the unit n-ball may increase with dimension, instead, it peaks at n = 5 and tends to 0 and n goes to infinity.

# Graph of volume vs. dimension

For each dimension I sample 50 million points from a hypercube centered at the origin with side length 2. By counting how many points are contained in the unit n-ball we arrive at a ratio of volumes between the two objects. Since we know the exact volume of the hypercube, estimating the volume of the n-ball simply amounts to multiplying the estimated ratio of volumes with the volume of the hypercube.

Code used to generate the plot:
```python
>>> max_dim = 21
>>> accuracy = 5 * 10**7
>>> plot_ball_vol(max_dim, accuracy)
```

The values generated by the program to make the graph are included in the folder for this program.
